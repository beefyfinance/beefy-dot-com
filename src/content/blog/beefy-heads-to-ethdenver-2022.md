Coming soon to the mountains of Colorado are the Beefy cow and team, ready to meet, greet, and BUIDL with innovators in the Ethereum ecosystem. And best of all, if you want to attend [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com/) too, it’s completely free. All you need to do is [apply](https://www.ethdenver.com/apply) on the ETHDenver website to secure a spot. So why not come and introduce yourself in person and learn more about what makes Beefy Finance tick?

### Why we’re looking forward to ETHDenver 2022

As the longest-running and largest Ethereum event globally, ETHDenver is a great place for Beefy to explore new opportunities, projects, and developments in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. Ethereum is where it all started, and Beefy can’t forget its roots and inspiration taken from yield optimizers on the blockchain.

### Meet the Beefy team

If you want to talk about everything DeFi, BUIDLing, or whatever else is on your mind, come and meet some of the Beefy team. You’re welcome to get in touch via our [Discord](https://beefy.finance/discord), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/beefyfinance), or [Telegram](https://t.me/beefyfinance). Weso will be in attendance from February 17-20, 2022, so make sure to arrange a chat before the event for the best chance of meeting our team. You can also visit our booth and even get your hands on some free Beefy t-shirts.

### Where can I learn more about your tech before the event?

If you’re not that familiar with Beefy and want to learn more about us before ETHDenver, a great place to get started is our [Docs](https://docs.beefy.finance/moo/). It contains all the information you will need to get a good understanding of our core concepts, history, and values. You can also look more about our tech on our [application’s Github page](https://github.com/beefyfinance/beefy-app).

## Conclusion

Make sure to come and visit us if you happen to be attending ETHDenver. It’s not often our usually virtual team makes a physical appearance, so you’re in for a rare treat. As mentioned, the event is totally free so long as you [apply](https://www.ethdenver.com/apply). So why not take a trip to Colorado? I hear the APY is beautiful there this time of year…

Beefy has been consistently known as the best place to stake your tokens. It goes without saying, If you have crypto you should really check out the [Beefy.com](http://beefy.com) app. There you’ll find more than 800 vaults that compound interest on your tokens, all without inflationary rewards. Simply earn more of what you stake.

At Beefy we believe that the future is decentralized, permissionless, trustless, and multi-chain. With this vision, we want to develop and support products that represent those values.

### What is Terra?

Terra is a layer 1 blockchain that allows for the creation of fiat-pegged stablecoins. To achieve this, Terra uses a seigniorage mechanism that maintains each stablecoins peg. The blockchain runs with a Delegated Proof of Stake consensus mechanism and has its own native utility token LUNA. 

### How does TerraUSD (UST) work?

Although Terra has a wide variety of stablecoins, TerraUSD (UST) is by far the most famous and popular. The token is pegged to the US Dollar, but unlike Tether or USDC, it doesn’t use fiat as collateral. Tether also differs from DAI’s crypto over-collateralization model.

To maintain a peg of one UST to one dollar, Terra uses algorithmic controls. 1 UST can always be converted to exactly one dollar’s worth of LUNA and vice versa. Terra burns any LUNA converted to UST, and 1 UST is always treated as being worth $1 when converting. When the currency is off its peg, arbitrage brings it back in line through market forces.

### Terra & Beefy working together

We believe that decentralized finance needs a decentralized stablecoin. For this reason Beefy applied for a [Terra Grant](https://agora.terra.money/t/proposal-beefy-x-moonpot-x-terra-partnership/5872) that passed with a [quorum of 64%](https://station.terra.money/proposal/1025). With this, we now have $400,000 UST to use to expand UST & LUNA adoption across the many chains Beefy is on.

To begin, we’re boosting the [newly launched 4pool](https://app.beefy.com/#/fantom/vault/curve-ftm-f-4pool) with $75,000 of UST starting right after the current $ORKAN boost finishes. This won’t be the last boost on the 4pool, so don’t move your stablecoins too far away!

The 4pool is a key component to keep UST pegged to other stablecoins. Curve is the leader in stableswaps, and having great liquidity in this pool is vital to keep UST with a healthy peg. That is why we decided to start with this boost.

We also won’t be just using the grant for boosts. We'll also share educational content about stablecoins, so you can make the best decisions with your tokens, and do giveaways to raise awareness.

If you have another vault candidate to boost, please [join our Discord Server](http://discord.gg/beefyfinance) and let us know which one you would like to see boosted with $UST.

### What does this mean for $BIFI holders

The team is constantly looking for opportunities to bring new products and benefits to our users and holders. These boosts will be aimed at attracting more TVL to the platform, give users better yields, and effectively generate more earnings to distribute.

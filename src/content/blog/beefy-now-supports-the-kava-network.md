## About Kava

Kava is a fast, secure Layer-1 blockchain with a unique co-chain architecture. It combines the speed and interoperability of the Cosmos SDK with the flexibility and developer support of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Developers can deploy Solidity smart contracts that interoperate seamlessly with Cosmos SDK protocols on the same blockchain, connecting their project to every major asset and millions of users.

Kava also runs the [Kava Rise](https://www.kava.io/rise#:\~:text=The%20Kava%20Rise%20program%20will,on%2Dchain%20based%20on%20usage.) program. The initiative rewards the top projects on Kava’s Ethereum and Cosmos Co-Chains with 200M KAVA over 4 years, distributed transparently on-chain based on usage.

## Why did we choose KAVA?

When deploying on the chain, the Beefy team considered many factors. These included the chain’s level of decentralization, its infrastructure set in place, and last but not least, the DeFi landscape.

Kava is currently home to some of the most recognized names in DeFi: Curve and SushiSwap, and now, Beefy. Beefy has launched the Curve 3pool Vault (USDC/USDT/DAI) and also has a range of SushiSwap Vaults to stake in.

## Ecosystem grants

With its highly transparent incentive program, Kava attracts the best protocols in the space to deploy on the chain. The Kava blockchain is 100% geared for growth, and their TVL-based incentive program fosters the deployment of big protocols on their mainnet.

## Getting your tokens to Kava

Multichain (formerly Anyswap) supports Kava, and there is a wide selection of tokens you can bridge. These include BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT, and DAI. You can also get a small amount of KAVA from [Surfswap’s Faucet](https://app.surfdex.io/bridge/faucet) for gas fees when making your first swaps and transactions.

There are currently five SushiSwap farms available:

1. [USDC-KAVA LP Vault](https://app.beefy.finance/vault/sushi-kava-wkava-usdc)

Beefy.Finance has recently deployed on the newly-launched Cronos blockchain to offer the safest and most reliable auto-compounding platform for DeFi users.

With the launch of Cronos, another giant joins the DeFi space, and they are doing it big. In less than one week, Cronos secured more than 500 million USD in total value locked (TVL) on their chain, and the number seems to only go up from there. There might be many reasons for this success. It could be the extremely nice APYs that VVS (a popular AMM on Cronos) offers. It could be that it is seamlessly integrated with Crypto.com. Or it could even be that people trust Crypto.com's endorsement. Maybe it's all three!

### About Cronos

Cronos is the first Cosmos EVM chain for DeFi, NFTs, and the Metaverse. It aims to massively scale the DeFi and decentralized application ecosystem, by providing developers with the ability to instantly port apps from Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. With its low cost, high throughput, fast finality, and built-in interoperability, Cronos is poised to bring decentralized applications to the 10M+ user base of the Crypto.com ecosystem and beyond.

### Beefy Vaults

The cow never sleeps. This is why our team has been looking at VVS smart contracts to create vaults that auto-compound VVS rewards with more of the deposited token. Just take a look for yourself at the amazing opportunities on offer with Cronos:

### How to reach Cronos

The best way to get money into Cronos (and into these vaults) is through the Crypto.com app and exchange. That's not much of a surprise! All you need to do is have your tokens on your Crypto.com account, and withdraw them to an external wallet. You can also use the [Crypto.com DeFi Wallet](https://crypto.com/defi-wallet) or [Cronos Bridge web app](https://cronos.crypto.org/bridge/) to bridge CRO from the Crypto.org chain to Cronos using the official decentralized bridge. The process is super straightforward, and if you run into any trouble, head to our [Discord server](https://beefy.finance/discord) for support.

Under our Discord's #cronos channel, you will find a pinned message with a step-by-step tutorial guiding you through the whole process. Keep in mind that you will need an account with KYC to take this approach. You will also find other alternatives there, like [Anyswap](https://anyswap.exchange/bridge) or [Elk](https://anyswap.exchange/#/router).

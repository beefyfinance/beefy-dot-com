The lunar tidal influence on rivers is undeniable. While the effect might not be the same on cows, they are at least gathering to drink from these new sources of DeFi water!

Beefy Finance truly believes in the multi-chain future with Moonriver becoming the 9th chain we deploy on. In this blog, we will learn a bit about the Moonriver parachain, how you can reach it, and the vaults we have deployed. Let’s get started!

### About Moonriver

Moonriver is a parachain on the Kusama network that launched in June 2021. It is a sister network of [**Moonbeam**](https://moonbeam.network/community/projects/) and provides an environment to test incentivized real economic conditions.

Moonriver is a community-led parachain, how’s that for decentralization?

If you want to try the chain out, check the following bridges:

[**Solarbeam Bridge**](https://app.solarbeam.io/bridge) (This bridge also works as a faucet, so you’ll all receive some **$MOVR** so you can transact on the chain)

[**Anyswap**](https://anyswap.exchange/) (you can send **$BIFI** and **$MIM**)

If you bridge your **$BIFI** vía Anyswap to Moonriver, you can utilize it to earn revenue from the platform as **$MOVR** tokens. To do this, stake your **$BIFI** into the BIFI Earn pool to receive **$MOVR** at around 100% APR (at the time of writing).

If you are having trouble, head over to our Discord server to find all the info you will need in the pinned messages of **_#-moonriver_**

### About Moonbeam

Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on the Polkadot network that makes it easy to build natively interoperable applications. This Ethereum compatibility allows developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and DApp frontends to Moonbeam with minimal changes. As a parachain on the Polkadot network, Moonbeam will benefit from the shared security of the Polkadot relay chain and integrations with other chains that are connected to Polkadot. Currently, in active development by PureStake, Moonbeam is expected to reach MainNet by Q4 of 2021. Learn more: [https://moonbeam.network/.](https://moonbeam.network/)

### Deployed vaults

The first vaults we are offering are from Solarbeam AMM. We will add more vaults in the future, so don’t miss out, follow @beefyfinance on Twitter. We have deployed vaults for all types of investors, blue chips, stablecoins, and even degen. If you want your favorite Moonriver platform added to Beefy, head over to our Discord and talk with the team.
